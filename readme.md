# 🧠 Code Snippet Organizer (C++ Console Project)

A console-based **Code Snippet Organizer** built in **C++** for managing and organizing programming snippets efficiently.  
Developed as part of the **Software Development I** course project.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Code Snippet Organizer** is a lightweight, console-based application that allows programmers to **store, view, search, edit, delete, and filter code snippets** easily.  
All snippets are stored persistently in a **binary file**, making it a simple yet powerful offline code management tool — built entirely using **C++** standard libraries.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a **medium-scale console project** in C++ that demonstrates:
- Proficiency in **file handling** (`ifstream`, `ofstream`, `fstream`)
- Application of **classes and structs**
- Modular, function-driven program design
- Data persistence using **binary storage**
- Real-world simulation of organizing and managing developer code snippets
